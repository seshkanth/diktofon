# Introduction #

Diktofon requests 3 capabilities (permissions) from the Android operating system.

## MODIFY/DELETE USB STORAGE CONTENTS MODIFY/DELETE SD CARD CONTENTS ##

Recordings, transcriptions, transcription tokens, tags, etc. are stored on the SD card. Make sure your device has an SD card and that it is mounted and writable.

When Diktofon is uninstalled all the stored data is removed. In case you want to keep it, you have to back it up into another folder before uninstalling Diktofon.


## FULL INTERNET ACCESS ##

Recordings are uploaded to the transcription server for speech-to-text. Note that depending on the availability of wifi and the type of your dataplan, this can be an expensive operation.

A recording is uploaded only if either

  * "Autotranscribe" is enabled (by default it is disabled),
  * if you long-press on the recording in the recordings list and select "Transcribe", or
  * if you open the menu and choose "Transcribe all".


## RECORD AUDIO ##

Used by the internal recorder.
