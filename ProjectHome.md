The **Diktofon** project develops a dictaphone application for Android-based smart phones. The application focuses on Estonian language speech recordings by including an interface to an online Estonian speech-to-text service (http://bark.phon.ioc.ee/webtrans/) to turn the recordings into written text. In addition to providing the transcription, this service also detects speakers in the recordings. This allows for novel and powerful ways to search, sort and playback the recordings, e.g.

  * you can easily locate in your set of recordings all the paragraphs where given words are mentioned, and then playback these paragraphs
  * you can sort your recordings by how many speakers they feature
  * you can "scroll" the recording to see where one speaker finishes and the next starts, useful when listening to podcasts or press conferences with multiple speakers

The Diktofon app provides also language independent features like tagging, high quality built-in voice recorder, possibility to use an external recorder app, etc. that turn it into a general purpose voice recorder and recording manager app.
